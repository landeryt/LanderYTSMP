## Before season 1:

The LanderYT SMP officially started on October 14th, 2021. Me, the server owner, had recently watched a video called "Joining random servers" which took place on the Minehut network, a popular server host at the time, known for its great server traffic.

Furthermore, I had just exited from a hermitcraft-style SMP who decided to implement their unique gimmick to the server, which I was not fond of. My philosophy for these kinds of servers is that, they should try their best to bring the hermitcraft experience to the public in the most efficient, authentic way, and steer away from twisting the concept too much. 

Hosting and moderating Servers have always been a distant dream throughout my childhood, and seeing a golden opportunity, I jumped at it to launch my own server, landeryt. 

Little did I know, I would sign up for almost 2 years of chaos. 

The first few days was me trying to recite my configuration skills back in the early days of Minecraft hosting. Thankfully, I still got it in me, and figured it out. 

I spent the rest of the pre-season 1 period experimenting with various possibilities, exploring the great 1.17 terrain and violently punishing rule breakers. This was also when I met a long-term staff member, CatKid09, who went on to become a frequent during season 2-4. 

## Season 1:

About a week after the launch of the pre-season, I have done it. I figured out the main skeleton of my dream server and opened it to the general public. 

Unfortunately we will hardly see any footage or images from any season before season 4, so you will have to take my word for it. 

I'm not exactly proud of what I managed to achieve with season 1, there were countless things I wished could've gone differently. 

Spawn wasn't located at 0 0. I put spawn at a random location in the world, which was a huge nuisance to the whole player base's gameplay. 

I simply couldn't manage to moderate the server, I was too rusty for this job. The influx of players overwhelmed me beyond understanding, never in my life have I imagined my server having 10+ players online simultaneously. Most of the players who joined in season 1 are no longer around; regardless, it was definitely a precious experience for a new server owner like me. 

I made random players staff members of season 1 simply because I couldn't be online all the time, however, I can't say I regretted my decision. A former staff member, now banned player, Nuggie, created the original discord server for the SMP as well as helped keep the server relatively in check while I deal with other duties. 

Season 1 was the shortest season in the LanderYT SMP. No players were able to finish their bases or achieve something meaningful. Spawn ended with a single shop owned by a player known as Max, which sold ores(?). 

I abruptly ended the season due to the 1.18 update dropping at an irregular period of the year. Players were not happy about it, and I deeply regret my decision. However, the closure of a chapter is the beginning of another...
