# LanderYT SMP History
Welcome! This is where I, LanderYT, write about the history of our server from my own recollection. There might be inaccuracies or lack of important information, and I am more than happy to receive your feedback.

## Before season 1:

The LanderYT SMP officially started on October 14th, 2021. Me, the server owner, had recently watched a video called "Joining random servers" which took place on the Minehut network, a popular server host at the time, known for its great server traffic.

Furthermore, I had just exited from a hermitcraft-style SMP who decided to implement their unique gimmick to the server, which I was not fond of. My philosophy for these kinds of servers is that, they should try their best to bring the hermitcraft experience to the public in the most efficient, authentic way, and steer away from twisting the concept too much. 

Hosting and moderating servers have always been a distant dream throughout my childhood, and seeing a golden opportunity, I jumped at it to launch my own server, landeryt. 

Little did I know, I would sign up for almost 2 years of chaos. 

The first few days was me trying to recite my configuration skills back in the early days of Minecraft hosting. Thankfully, I still got it in me, and figured it out. 

I spent the rest of the pre-season 1 period experimenting with various possibilities, exploring the great 1.17 terrain and violently punishing rule breakers. This was also when I met a long-term staff member, CatKid09, who later went on to become a frequent during season 2-4. 

## Season 1:

About a week after the launch of the pre-season, I have done it. I figured out the main skeleton of my dream server and opened it to the general public. 

Unfortunately we will hardly see any footage or images from any season before season 4, so you will have to take my word for it. 

I'm not exactly proud of what I managed to achieve with season 1, there were countless things I wished could've gone differently. Spawn wasn't located at 0 0. I put spawn at a random location in the world, which was a huge nuisance to the whole player base's gameplay. 

I simply couldn't manage to moderate the server, I was too rusty for this job. The influx of players overwhelmed me beyond understanding, never in my life have I imagined my server having 10+ players online simultaneously. Most of the players who joined in season 1 are no longer around; regardless, it was definitely a precious experience for a new server owner like me. 

I made random players staff members of season 1 simply because I couldn't be online all the time, however, I can't say I regretted my decision. A former staff member, now banned player, Nuggie, created the original discord server for the SMP as well as helped keep the server relatively in check while I deal with other duties. 

Season 1 was the shortest season in the LanderYT SMP. No players were able to finish their bases or achieve something meaningful. Spawn ended with a single shop owned by a player known as Max, which sold ores(?). 

I abruptly ended the season due to the 1.18 update dropping at an irregular period of the year. Players were not happy about it, and I deeply regret my decision. However, the closure of a chapter is the beginning of another...

## Season 2:

Season 2 was when it really became serious for me, this whole server owning thing. I realised that I finally cultivated a community, albeit small (20-30 players) for the time being. Folks, this was when it really picked up. 

I've finalised my exit from the server that inspired the LanderYT SMP. Even then, on the way out, I picked up a few more important lessons for my server, which I still use to this day. First of all, spawn is now placed at 0 0, the center of the world. I've also figured out how to give the spawn area build protection, so that the nasty children of Minehut at least can't do player or property damage, 5 seconds into the server.

In season 2, I began to play survival seriously for the first time in a year, on my own server. How exciting was that? I teamed up with 3 players, all from Australia: Rose, Mika and Tonka, who all went on to become staff members for my server. I have to admit, I just really wanted my good friends to help me out with the server even more, especially during my downtime. I'm not proud of what I did back then, I did not put a single bit of effort into learning how to build decently (I was originally a plain combatant). Instead, I constructed every automatic farm I could have imagined, and it made my season 2 base look like a big mess.

Mika and Tonka were the ones responsible for all the nice things in my base, and I was the sole resource provider for those talented builders. We also went on to give the server spawn a more pleasant look.

I experimented with a lot of unique plugins in season 2, completely steering off what I intended for the community. I remember, at one point, I did weekly updates to the server, where every week, I would remove last week's gimmick and add the current week's plugin. It was a lot of fun. We had the seasons plugin, which caused some mild buffs and debuffs during the 4 seasons. We also had the custom music plugin, where players can request the addition of various songs, such as Rickroll or Crab Rave. Unfortunately, I did not have the time nor energy to deal with these additional features, so all of which eventually came to an end.

We kept the world border at 4000 blocks each direction, which was more than enough for my current playerbase's needs.

#### Events and Ranks:

This is the season that I began hosting events seriously. Hide and seek, Lander Says, "Run to the coords", Rainbow Run and Tag made their first appearance on the server this season. To this day, Hide and Seek and Lander Says are still really popular events on the server, and I dare say, the most popular events, while Rainbow Run remained as the server tiebreaker. The way I rewarded players were also unique this season. Instead of handing out event tokens nowadays, I placed 10 signs where event winners have to pick from. I wrote all sorts of rewards and punishments on the back of the signs, such as Diamonds, Dirt, Golden Carrots and Rank Upgrades.

Let's talk about Ranks. From season 1 to season 3, normal players can obtain 2 ranks: VIP and MVP. During season 2, VIP and MVP had access to /nick and more /sethomes. I believe that the ranks had even more functionalities, but I cannot recall more. The only way to obtain a rankup was from participating in events. This was extremely unfair because most events back then required a bit of skill.

#### Shopping district:

For the first time, we had an established shopping district. I was lucky enough to stumble on a plugin called TradeShops, a plugin that allows players to right click on a sign to trade their currency, in this case always Diamonds, for the item they desired on the sign. This method prevented the immature rulebreakers of Minehut to steal from player shops first thing. During the creation of this history page, it occurred to me that the majority of the shops in season 2 belonged to a staff member. We had:
* Maccas, a food shop by Rose.
* Alchemy shop by Mika.
* Stone and amethyst shop by Tonka.
* Axolotl shop by Sunny, who was also a staff member.
* Banner shop (?) by CatKid09, also a staff.
* Pop-up enchantment book shop by REALspelgubbe, which later became inactive and LanderYT had to step in and create a similar shop on the other side of the road.
* Honey shop by jjboyisawesome.
* Rocket shop by flamingXD.
* Totem shop by someone I don't remember.
* Prismarine shop by Rose.

#### Staff Team:
Enough with the shopping district, let's go over our staff team! Season 2 staff team was the biggest ever on the server, with 10 members at one point. We had: Rose, Mika, Tonka, Ghastly, Jello, Sunny, Cat, Akarni. I might have forgotten someone, sucks to suck. 

Ghastly and Jello were a pair of chaotic staff members, and I'm sure they were proud of it anyway. They eventually committed some tomfoolery which resulted in their demotion, but I welcomed them back on the server and we still remain on good terms to this day. 

Sunny and Cat, however, were vastly different in terms of perspective when it comes to how they conduct their gameplay on the server. I believe that Cat was into a more laid-back style, she built this horse stable and, you guessed it, had a lot of horses. Sunny, on the other hand, were just as chaotic as the pair above. She constructed the great colloseum, where great pvp battles happened. LanderYT still has not lost a single match. Anyway, this eventually led to the collapse of their relationship. Sunny never came back after the end of the third season, and Cat is a rare recurring character of the server to this day. 

Akarni, who was really shy in her first season on the server, went on to become one of the most chaotic staff members. 

#### Notable Members:
* REALspelgubbe, the player with the highest playtime in season 2, managed to collect a shulker full of elytras and spent a lot of time flexing that fat shulker of his, only to die in some random bastion.

#### Conclusion
The season ended as I felt server activity going down, and I "thought" a reset was what the community needed. It took me a long time after, to realise that the dip in activity was normal annually due to finals. It did work out eventually, and we started... season 3. 

## Season 3:
Welcome to season 3 of the LanderYT SMP. Thank you for reading this far, I'm sure you have had a great time enjoying my two cents. 

Anyway, for season 3, Sunny, my best staff member at the time, suggested we start out on an island in the middle of the ocean. I was so on board with the idea that me, together with the rest of my staff team, conjured up a very detailed plan for spawn, and it worked out amazingly. 

#### Changelog:
Season 3 saw the panic that washed over me, where I frantically tried to revert back to the way I intended our SMP to be. I removed home teleport commands completely, leaving only /spawn. This change, together with the fact that spawn was in the middle of the ocean, made the lives of season 3 players miserable. 

I was also extremely worried about the griefing that always happen when I take a good night's sleep. Therefore, I introduced GriefPrevention, the world's most popular land claiming plugin. Players can now claim their land to protect themselves from nasty griefers. However, I did not figure out a good way to distribute claim blocks to those who actually needed it, which caused a lot of nuisance to the community. 

The world border remained at 4000 blocks each direction, which led to an unexpected problem. Since we were playing in the new 1.19 update, the update where they added the Ancient City and Wardens, everyone wanted a piece of that. However, due to the small size of the border, it was not possible for anyone to get their hands on the new swift sneak enchantment. 

Since GriefPrevention plugin was in play in season 3, this directly meant that I had to get rid of my usual WorldGuard plugin that I used to secure spawn. However, this opened up an opportunity to create a specific area in spawn where all players can modify, the **Season 3 spawn farm**.

![Season 3 spawn farm](https://github.com/landeryt/LanderYTSMP/assets/145010136/6bcfd6b3-a2cf-4cc6-bc13-ae0c09f52016)

Season 3 spawn farm was the place where players can gather food for their long ocean journey. Sounds noble right? Wrong. I also wanted to use the farm as a way to catch griefers early. Every morning, I would wake up, use CoreProtect to check who griefed the farm and ban like 10 people. I love banning people. In fact, season 3 was when we reached over 4000 banned players, an insane number for the Minehut network back then. 

Finally, we introduced the creative portal, which takes ranked and trusted players to the creative world, where they can design their builds and participate in my events.

#### Spawn and Shopping District:

Spawn was located at 0 0 like the previous season, except this time, it was on a boat built by CatKid09. Loved the concept. Just south of the spawn boat was my house, where I resided for the better part of the season. I did not participate in playing survival in season 3. I also kept a sheep called Lamber, who we will come back to, later in this seaason history. 

Spawn was built completely in survival for the first time on the LanderYT SMP. We went through a lot of planning and trial and error to achieve season 3 spawn. If I have to rate, season 3 spawn was my second favorite spawn so far, after season 5's, the current season as of the time I wrote this history page.

Shops were scattered on the north and west side of the spawn island. We didn't have nearly as many shops as we did in season 2, partly because of the lack of space as well as the dictation of shop styles from my side. I wanted shops designed as ships in the marina to the north of spawn, but not everyone wanted to build a ship for their shop. 

We also had a nether hub this season! We adapted a very interesting tunnel design, which required hundreds of hours into the creation and resource-gathering period. 

Finally, on every dock in the 4 directions of spawn, we added a boat dispenser so that new players can easily navigate out of spawn. However, since the button is accessible to everyone, I always wake up to a bunch of boats lying around because of a naughty child. 

#### Staff Team:
There were even more demotions from the staff team leading up to the end of the season. However, there were a few positive thing that happened, such as the introduction of Minachu to the staff team. 

Minachu is a player who began playing in season 2 of the LanderYT SMP, but only became more active at the start of the new season 3. She rised through the ranks in the staff team swiftly, eventually, for the first time, and possibly only time in the LanderYT SMP, we had an Admin. 

We also welcomed Red to the staff team, and he continued to help the server in various ways to present day.

#### Downfall:

When the school year recommenced in September 2022, I also moved to Turkey to begin my education as a college student. Not many, even the owner, wanted to play on the server. It was truly the darkest hours of the server. 

Then, on a faithful day of the End Fight, disaster struck. Multiple active players died and lost all their items during their entrance to the end dimension, due to FlamingXD (needs confirmation) dropping TNT into the end portal. When I refused to return the items to the players, the group began wrecking havoc to the structures. They murdered Lamber, my sheep, in cold blood, as well as did minor damage to the nether hub and spawn. 

On a beautiful November day, I decided on the closure of the LanderYT SMP for good, and deleted the discord server. Or so I thought.

## Season 4:

I never thought this day would ever come, but I don't think I could ever get Minecraft out of my head. It's an indispensible part of my life, and not in a bad way. I genuinely feel like I've become a better person thanks to Minecraft. So, I wanted to restart on the survival content on my Youtube channel. And I thought, what better way to post survival content than making a let's play series on my channel?

[I did it](https://youtu.be/5mMBqThWr4k?si=LqdOx0tJ2whecT-X). I began posting again on my channel a series called How I made my Minecraft SMP, where the goal was to show the entire process of setting up a server like mine. However, it didn't take long for me to realise that players were much more into the gaming content than the behind the scenes stuff of my server. Consequently, from [episode 3](https://youtu.be/WwgJzsC_YUU?si=tt_c2ooQxOCcHHqL) on, I moved entirely to just Minecraft gameplay.

When the server was finally back, I started contacting the veteran players, and to my surprise, almost all of them returned at various points during season 4. I was so grateful to have you all back. 

#### Changelog:

We went back to building spawn in creative mode again, because I didn't have enough people who I trust to build it in survival. I was mostly on my own, with the occasional help from CatKid09, who made a return to the staff team. 

Shopping district was located on the west side of spawn, a completely seperate region to spawn area. We had a decent number of shops that popped up. It was nice. I'm tired.

I constructed a trap building right outside of spawn, where griefers will be blown up if they attempt to open the trapped chest. It claimed hundreds of lives. I'm so proud of the trap building. 

#### What happened:

Nothing particularly bad happened, except for the fatal error in July 2023 I made to the world file which resulted in the deletion of nearly everything. Yeah, that's about it. Following the blunder, I was forced to start a new season and disappoint my current player base. 

There was this town 'Potato Town' only 300 blocks from spawn, while we're still hooked to Minehut, owned by a player called Rufuswastaken. Every single player from this town was banned except for Rufus, who went on to go inactive. 

Nevertheless, season 4 was a great stepping stone and a massive confidence boost for me, going into season 5, our current season as of writing time. I met many players who went on to become the backbone of my player base, as well as finally made the groundbreaking decision to cut ties with Minehut, who were going on a downward spiral to their loyal customers. Until this point, I have personally paid every penny to the hosts to keep the server running. That will no longer be the case from season 5 on. 

## Season 5:

Welcome to season 5 of the LanderYT SMP! I continued working on my survival series in the new season, and we will be hitting the 12th episode soon in June! 

#### Changelog:

Before launching the new season, I booted a test server where me and a few trusted players began working on the construction of season 5 spawn. Season 5 spawn went on to become the most beautiful team creation I've ever witnessed. [Spawn Build Video](https://youtu.be/M660hlMrXdY?si=5EBHOZBFMpjKpoB_)

A few weeks following the launch of the server, I was worried about the prospects of uninvited rulebreakers, and seeing that I've finally figured out how to advertise the server to players from other sources, I was led to the decision of turning whitelist on. You bet your bottom dollar I won't be turning it on any time soon. 

I went on to make the server more and more accessible to the players within, such as gradually removing the build restrictions as well as listening more to the community's suggestions.

#### As of now:
Later on in the season, me and a player known as Charlotte had a friendly prank war which was very fun, and it was possibly the first ever war that was 100% friendly and without bad blood. The war ended with an intense 1v1 pvp battle between LanderYT and B1AC_K - the representative of Charlotte's side, with LanderYT coming out on top.

Season 5 has been going on for 10 months, the longest season so far in the LanderYT SMP. The community has been nothing but amazing, and our current players have been staying because of the community, not because of the server. I know that I have achieved something special when I noticed this trend. Thank you for reading, and if you want anything modified in this history page, please don't hesitate to reach out!
