# LanderYT SMP Life Series

## Rules
- First and foremost, we are a group of friends, so please don't hold a grudge (unless the server goes after Lander unprovoked)
- Max team size 3, but if we have a high number of participants then we will reconsider a limit of 5.
- Green and yellow lives may not participate in outright pvp unless it's boogey or self-defense.
- Griefing and stealing are *technically* allowed, but do so with the consideration of others and for CONTENT, not malicious intent.
- Boogeyman will be selected 5 minutes into the session, with a small chance of having more than one boogeyman.
- Watchers (Spectators) may observe but not chat/talk during the session, unless it's a player who perma-died.
- Lecterns, bookshelves, mace, all helmets, elytras are banned and cannot be obtained.
- Strength, instant health, instant damage potions are banned.
- Most pvp-based enchants will automatically be set to lvl 1.

## List of players
This is hand-picked from the players who signed up for the life series, depending on how active and how long they have been around, so that we can decide whether one is capable of attending regularly. You still have time to prove otherwise to the server by remaining an integral part of our community.
