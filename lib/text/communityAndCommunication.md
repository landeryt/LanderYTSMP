## Community and Communication

It is undeniable that the community is the most important aspect of the server. In fact, it has been proven that most players stay for the community, not because our server has any specific gimmick. We take community feedback seriously, and we include discussions with members of the community about both minor and major upheavals to the server. The community, or you guys, have helped the server thrive, and me (LanderYT), cannot be more grateful for your partipation. 

We have a Discord Server to efficiently communicate with the players outside of the game on this server. This is where all the information, announcements and rules are written and many interactions with players take place. If you are whitelisted, this is where you will get notified about events and you can hang out in Voice Chats.

However, that's not the only way people can reach out to us. Players and potential visitors alike can also reach out to us via one of the following channels:
#### [LanderYT's Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/skylanderyt)
#### [LanderYT SMP PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/server/landeryt-smp-semi-vanilla-whitelist-1-20-1-events-16-hermitcraft-like-lgbtq-friendly/)

## New Players

As long as the LanderYT SMP is still running, we will always be recruiting more members. Moreover, seeing as season 7, which is expected to start in August 2025 is fast approaching, it will mean more when you join us!

Keep in mind that we take great care in looking at these whitelist applications through Discord. We only whitelist those who are over 16 and put effort into what they write in their applications.
