# Season 6 head hunt event  

This is the first addition to LanderYT SMP season 6. Head hunt takes inspiration from hermitcraft season 6 as well as egg hunt of hermitcraft season 8. 

## What is Head Hunt?
Head Hunt is a passive, long-term event where players take turns to hide a specific block/item. In this case, it will be the skull of LanderYT, the owner. This information might change in later editions. The winner of the event is determined by how long one is able to keep the head hidden in their base. This event is expected to last 1 week.  

## Rules
**1. Hiding**
* Players will hide the LanderYT head in a man-made building within the boundaries of their base.
* The building in question must not be underground, too tall from the ground, underwater, unlit, in the nether or ambiguous. Basements and mine entrances will also not be allowed. 
* The head must be exposed to **plain sight** from at least 2 sides. Plain sight means it should not be obstructed even by chests, trapdoors, carpets and more.
* Accessing the head must not involve any quirks or movement aids whatsoever such as enderpearls, crawling or breaking/placing blocks.
* Accessing the head must be possible to near beginners of Minecraft, so contraptions and parkour are also off-limits.
* Hiders are required to provide coordinates within 50 block radius of their hiding spot.
* After alerting the coordinates, the hider must not change the location of the head.  

**2. Seeking**
* Upon finding the head, seekers will alert the server in the designated head hunt channel on discord, with a screenshot as evidence. They are then required to hide the head at their base, then alert the server again with the coordinates according to Hiding rules.
* Seekers have up to 6 hours to hide the head before being disqualified. 
* Seekers must not use any movement aids or tricks to access potential hiding spots.  

**3. Timing**
* The winner of the event will be determined by how long the player is able to keep the head hidden.
* The timer for a player starts when the hider alerts the server of the coordinates, and ends when the head is found.

**4. Rewards**
* Every player/team to find a head is guaranteed one event coin. If a team finds it, they still only receive one single coin.
 The longer one hides the head, the more event coins they earn: 
* 7 event coins to winner.
* 5 event coins to runner-up.
* 4 event coins to third place.
* 1-3 event coins depending on time hidden.

**5. Teaming**
* Players may choose to participate as a solo player, however, their teammates are not allowed to seek when that player is in possession of the head.
* All participants must register within the first day of the event.  

**6. Other**
* Any action deemed to have broken the event rules will lead to disqualification or subtraction of hiding hours.
