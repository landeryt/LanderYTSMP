## Owners
### LanderYT
Howdy.

I'm LanderYT, you can call me Lander. I'm the proud owner of the LanderYT SMP. This server is my longest and biggest ever personal project yet, and I couldn't be more proud of it. I'm from Vietnam, the country of rice farmers. Currently, I'm a full-time student in Software Engineering in Turkey. Similar to many of you, I relate to the struggles of student life. I have been with this community since October 14th, 2021, and we never put our feet off the gas. 

Often times I'll be marked as Online on discord, so feel free to reach out if you want to chat or have any questions ^^. I come across as a very short-tempered person, especially when it comes to the well-being of my server, players or breach of rules. However, once you look past that, I can be a very pleasant person to hang out with. A select few players have managed to break through the hard shell of mine and couldn't be happier with the real me. 

I'm sorted into the Hufflepuff house (of Hogwarts). Frankly, I think it's the most suitable house for me. I'm not too extreme on any front and just want to bring the good to everyone. I have yet to find my real passion, but for the time being, what I do like are:

* Cooking, I just got into it for a couple of months, I cannot cook very complicated stuff, but I love it nonetheless.
* Programming, it's starting to decline in me, but I try to remain sharp and fast.
* Youtube. I have a [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/skylanderyt)!
* Travelling. I must admit, I'm not the full-on travelling enthusiast, and I don't think I want to. Either way, travelling every now and then makes me happy.


## Admins


## Moderators
### shallowcreek
hello. I’m theta :creek: ,but you can call me by my Minecraft username creek. I’m a moderator of the server. (But lander does most of the moderation lmao) lover of sad guitar music,horrible chess player, angst writer.
My life has gotten a lot busier nowadays, so I may not check discord as much. Ping me if you need anything.
I may come of as harsh. Please bear with me.
My interests include watching you guys on vanish,drawing, reading and writing. My favourite book is flowers for algernon.
Have a nice day! 

### Macky
Hi everyone!! I'm Macky! I am fairly new to the Lander SMP server, I joined in Sept. of 2024. I have been playing minecraft since I was around 9 years old and switched over to Java only two years ago! My play style is building! I love creating new things and turning the world into something beautiful. I am in college IRL to become an occupational therapist so if you ever need me I am just a DM away!
