## Who are we?

Welcome to LanderYT SMP!

We are a friendly semi-vanilla Minecraft server that puts our community first. The LanderYT community started in October 14th, 2021, but we've been through 6 seasons, and going into the 7th. We are a community with an immense love for the vanilla aspect of Minecraft.

We consider ourselves a community of peaceful, friendly and mature players. We are an open and accepting community that strives for our players to feel safe and free of any harassment, trolling, or toxicity. Furthermore, we also host various events on the server when it gets populated.
