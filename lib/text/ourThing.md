## Old Concept, New Experience

The LanderYT Server has always and will always be an SMP Server. We use Plugins to help enhance the player experience, however, nothing game-breaking ultimately making us a Semi-Vanilla server. Our server takes inspiration from hermitcraft but we made some tweaks to make it playable for the general public.

## Enhanced Vanilla

We use some plugins and datapacks to enchance the gameplay and improve some in game tasks and experiences. If you're interested seeing a quick list of the plugins and datapacks we use, [click here](https://github.com/landeryt/LanderYTSMP/wiki#6-plugins-and-datapacks)
